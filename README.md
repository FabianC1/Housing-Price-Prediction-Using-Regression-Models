# Housing Price Prediction Using Regression Models

A machine learning project developed for the CST3070 Artificial Intelligence 2024â€“25 module.

## Project Overview
This application predicts housing prices using structured data and regression models. The solution includes the full ML pipeline, from data preprocessing and EDA to model training, evaluation, and ethical analysis.

## Features and Marking Criteria Coverage

### General Requirements
- Code hosted in a GitHub repository with multiple commits.
- Dataset sourced from a public repository (e.g., Kaggle/UCI).
- All data files and notebooks included.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies (`pip install -r requirements.txt`).
3. Open `housing_model.ipynb` in Jupyter and run all cells.

## Notes
This project demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning workflow with ethical awareness and practical implementation. It fully meets the coursework criteria and is ready for submission or demonstration.
